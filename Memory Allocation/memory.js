/*In memory there are 2 segments they are

// Primitive data types will be stored only in stack
// Refernce types will be stored only in heap
/* after storing the refernce type in the heap
   the heap will generate a pointer where the address of the refernce type which is stored in heap
   That pointer will be stored in stack */
